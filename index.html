                            A simulator where balls bounce off walls at random speeds. 
                            The colours of the balls are randomly generated by a set of pallates.
                            When the mouse hovers over any of the balls they grow, and shrink
                            back to normal after leaving the mouse's area of effect.
                            Random velocities and speeds are calculated for each ball.

                This page simulates balls of random sizes and speeds scrolling 
                along the speed at random sarting positions. The colours are once 
                again chosen from random pallates. The balls also wrap around the screen
                intead of them bouncing back off the screen.
